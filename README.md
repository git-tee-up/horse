# Giddyup.Horse

This is a GitHub Pages repo for the [giddyup.horse](https://giddyup.horse/) website ([git-tee-up.github.io/horse/](https://git-tee-up.github.io/horse/)). This website is maintained by anyone and everyone that wants to. Anyone is free to invite themselves to be a collaborator on this repo, an invite will automatically be sent, and then they'll be able to push changes to this repo.

## Contributing

There are a few guidelines. Mostly, please don't be an ass and get this repo/account banned. We're all software developers just making cool, fun stuff.

### Guidelines

* **No** racist, sexist, homophobic, violent, fraudulent, spam, or illegal content, or anything else that would violate GitHub's [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service) or [Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines)
* **Do Not** touch the `CNAME` file
* **Do Not** be an ass to other people making changes, or insist that things have to be a certain way
* **Please** leave the text in this README.md file alone above and including the line that says `^ LEAVE THIS STUFF ALONE ^`. This way everyone can read the guidelines and learn how to contribute
* Keep in mind, all commits are public

## Saddle Up

First, invite yourself to be a collaborator on this repo by using the [Saddle](https://git-tee-up.github.io/saddle/), which is another GitHub Pages site. The Saddle calls out to an AWS Lambda endpoint, which will invite whatever username was entered on that page to become a collaborator on this repo.

Once you've invited yourself, you'll need to check your email and approve the invitation before you can start contributing to the repo. After you've approved the invitation, all is good! You can start contributing to this repo.

## Recommended Starting

A good place to start contributing, might be to just add your name to the `Contributors` list on the website (if it's still there). I'd recommend still following the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), even if you plan to modify this website all by yourself. This flow would typically look something like:

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a branch for your work
3. Do all your work inside your branch, committing and merging with `master` often
4. Create a pull request for your branch into the `master` branch
5. Make sure your branch is fully up to date and merged with the `master` branch and there are no merge conflicts in your pull request
    1. *Optional* - If you want, find somebody else to review and approve your pull request, or simply wait a few minutes to see if anyone steps up. Ideally, someone else can put their eyes on your code first, just in case you made an error somewhere. Feel free to reach out to me ([@rickjerrity](https://twitter.com/rickjerrity)) on Twitter/GitHub if you want your pull request reviewed.
6. Complete your pull request into `master`

This GitHub Pages project is configured to use the `master` branch for the source, so as soon as your changes are pushed to the `master` branch, a build should start, and the changes should be deployed to the website shortly after. GitHub Pages does have some [usage limits](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#usage-limits), which can affect build time, as well as other factors on the site/repo, so be sure to pay attention to those.
